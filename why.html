            Why I like cats!
        </h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                I like cats becase of the fact that they are very independent, the fact that they don't really need human help aside from litter boxes and food, and the fact that they are super cute! Not only that, they also are very cuddly if they like you. although some may say that they aren't as good as dogs, I would disagree. People can say that they don't go out with you, but that would only be because of the fact that they prefer alone time. This really isn't a problem if you got a more extroverted cat. Another benefit of them is that they aren't as heavy as dogs so cats can lay on you whenever!
